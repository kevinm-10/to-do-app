# to-do-app
This simple web app uses JavaScript,HTML,CSS
The Javascript allows for the process such as crossing out the task on command 
It also initiates the check mark when clicked on 
The CSS styles contains just over 100 lines of code from the style of the background all the way to the style that is affected when hovering over
The HTML file is relatively short since all that was needed was the name of the app itself as the title 
as well as using it as a way to integrate the CSS and Javascript files into it
